Graph Analytics extracts valuable insights from complex, interconnected data with ability to represent relationships between entities.

𝔾𝕣𝕒𝕡𝕙 ℂ𝕠𝕞𝕡𝕠𝕤𝕚𝕥𝕚𝕠𝕟:

- Nodes: represent entities
- Edges: link between entities

𝔾𝕠𝕒𝕝𝕤 𝕠𝕗 𝔾𝕣𝕒𝕡𝕙 𝔸𝕟𝕒𝕝𝕪𝕥𝕚𝕔𝕤:

*͠ Identify key entities and their relationships
*͠ Discover patterns and anomalies in large-scale datasets
*͠ Generate recommendations and predictions based on past behavior
*͠ Uncover community structures within networks
*͠ Predict missing links and uncover hidden connections

Ⓞ Label Propagation
Ⓞ Walktrap
Ⓞ Fastgreedy

𝔾𝕣𝕒𝕡𝕙 𝔸𝕟𝕒𝕝𝕪𝕥𝕚𝕔𝕤 𝕋𝕖𝕔𝕙𝕟𝕚𝕢𝕦𝕖𝕤:

➊ Graph Traversal: Visit every node in a graph, typically in a systematic order.

➋ Shortest Path: Aim to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

➌ Connected Components: Identify groups of nodes that are all connected to each other.

➍ Minimum Spanning Tree: Find the minimum set of edges needed to connect all nodes in a graph.

➎ Maximum Flow: Find the maximum amount of flow that can pass through a graph, given constraints on the edges.
